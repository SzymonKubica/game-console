# This script allows for ensuring that the neovim LSP based on clangd works
# with the project both when we are developing native arduino code and the
# emulator code. The thing is that the library dependencies for those two use
# cases are fundamentally incompatible.
#
# Because of this, we need to tell clangd which compile commands file is to be
# used. This is done through the .clangd configuration file. The problem is that
# clangd does not allow specifing which .clangd file is to be soruced, so if
# we want to change the configuration conditionally depending on which platform
# we want to target for development, we need to actually overwrite the .clangd
# file with the desired settings.
#
# This script accepts the name of the platform (arduino/emulator). Based on this
# input, it will overwrite the .clangd file with either .clangd-arduino or .clangd-emulator
